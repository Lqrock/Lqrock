Hey,
I'm Siavash, a 22 yo Computer Science student studying and practicing Java development.
I'm always trying to learn something new, and always pushing myself to be better at the things I know and to learn the things I don't know.
Feel free to contact me for anything! I'm always looking to participate in your java projects and happy to learn from you
